The project consist of a web application on react, backend on node and mongo db and for managing the products and orders we have a admin panel as well.
ADMIN PANEL : https://tomato-food-del-admin-xi.vercel.app/
FRONTEND WEB APPLICATION : https://tomato-food-del-frontend.vercel.app/
We have an authentication functionality enabled helpful for ordering a food and also to see your orders in my orders page, I tried to make it responsive as well for the mobile devices.
Functionalities we have: 
1. A user can see all the products in the main page.
2. A user can register / login.
3. A user can add to cart products and see those in the cart page with all other details.
4. A user can proceed to payment using stripe.
5. A user can also see all of his recent orders uptil now and also track the status.
6. A user can filter products as well.
7. From the admin panel, admin can perform a CRUD operation inc add to the store, remove from the store, see all the listing.
8. Admin can also see the coming orders, admin can update the status from processing -> out for delivery -> delivered.
9. The updated status can be seen in the frontend, if the uesr is login.
